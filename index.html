    <p>
      <span>Hello! My name is Shaina Shultz. I graduated from Washington University in St. Louis with a BSBA in Marketing and a minor in Design. I use a 2015 15" Macbook pro as my computer. While I have not had any experience with coding prior to this class, I am well versed in design. I look forward to learning throughout the course of this Web Coding Intensive Bootcamp. </span>

    <p> Getting started I faced a few issues. The first was figuring out how to install SSL certification. Eventually, I resolved this issue by verifying my email. Once that was complete, I was able to install the certification, but the order stalled in process. I contacted DreamHost, and they resolved the issue. After that, I did not experience any more issues.
